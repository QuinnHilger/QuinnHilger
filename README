Welcome to Quinn Hilger's Github Repository.

I am a second year student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).
I'm currently looking for internships in software engineering for the summer of 2023. 
A copy of my resume can be found in this repository.
I'm also open to contribute to the developement of side projects, or looking for anyone 
who would like to help contribute to mine.

Fell free to reach me at quinnhilger@gmail.com

Thank you!
